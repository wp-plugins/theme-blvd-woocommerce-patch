= What does this plugin do? =

This plugin accomplishes a few things in order to put the primary pieces for WooCommerce in place with your Theme Blvd theme.

1. Adds appropriate Theme Blvd wrappers around the main content of WooCommerce.
2. Forces all WooCommerce pages to take on the "Sidebar Right" sidebar layout.
3. Adds custom "WooCommerce Sidebar" widget area that is incorporated into all WooCommerce pages.
4. Adds option to Theme Blvd "Page Options" that allows you to designate a static page as a WooCommerce page. -- For example, when you incorporate a WooCommerce shortcode into a page (i.e. My Account, Shopping Cart, etc), you can then designate that page as a WooCommerce page in order to display the approriate sidebar and sidebar layout.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `theme-blvd-woocommerce-patch` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Screenshots ==

1. Here's an example of some WooCommerce's sample content being displayed with the plugin and [Alyeska](http://themeforest.net/item/alyeska-responsive-wordpress-theme/164366?ref=themeblvd "Alyeska WordPress Theme").
2. After installing this plugin, you should see a new widget area added above all of your Theme Blvd widget areas called "WooCommerce Sidebar" -- Put all of your widgets here for WooCommerce-related pages. 
3. When editing a standard static page, there will now be an option under your theme's standard "Page Options" that will allow you to designate the current static page as a "WooCommerce page" -- This will allow the WooCommerce Sidebar to be applied.
